# Remarks
- This project is in progress.

# About sharing data
- This project largely relies on the death register data from Oregon and Washington, which are not supposed to be publicly shared or disclosed.
- Code files for cleaning the register data to unify the classification schemes and for collecting covariates will be shared here.
